# 🧟 Apocalypse Tech Rising

A post-apocalyptic Minecraft modpack built around relentless zombies, advanced automation, and creative base defense.

> This repository contains **all config files and KubeJS scripts** for the public Apocalypse Tech Rising modpack and server. Everything here is **free to use** — feel free to copy, modify, or reuse it for your own server or pack.

## 🌍 Overview

In a world overrun by ever-stronger zombies and terrifying creatures, survival isn't just about combat — it's about outsmarting the apocalypse.

Build up powerful defenses with **Mekanism**, **Create**, and other advanced tech mods. Grow critical resources with **Mystical Agriculture** and control inventory chaos using **Refined Storage** and **Applied Energistics 2**.

**Moon phases affect danger levels**, so plan carefully — enemies grow stronger over time, and your tech must evolve faster to survive.

🧠 Base defense is encouraged through **automation**, **trap systems**, and **smart design** — mob griefing is disabled, but enemies are relentless.
